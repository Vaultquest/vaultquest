# Backend Service Architecture (#24)

This document is the foundation called out in issue #24: a documented
backend scaffold with explicit boundaries between the public API,
event-ingestion path, and worker runtime, plus the schema/migration story
that supports issues #13 and #14 without inventing a new platform later.

## Service boundaries

   └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The three concerns are intentionally co-located in one repo but kept
in distinct modules so they can be split into separate processes (or
horizontally scaled independently) later without rewriting the data model:

- **API surface** — `src/routes/*` + `src/app.ts`. Pure Fastify handlers.
  Validates with Zod (`src/schemas/*`), delegates to `LedgerService`,
  serializes through a single `serialize()` helper for stable response
  shapes.
- **Indexing inbound** — `POST /internal/reconcile` is the *only* write
  path the event indexer (issue #13) touches. Authenticated by
  `X-Internal-Secret` (`AppDeps.internalSecret`). The handler delegates
  straight into `LedgerService.reconcileEvent`, which is replay-safe
  (event-first writes go to `PendingEvent` and are claimed when the
  intent eventually attaches its `tx_hash`).
- **Processed-event checkpointing** — the indexer also persists the last
  processed paging token alongside the ledger checkpoint, so a restart can
  resume from the next unread event instead of replaying an entire batch.
- **Worker runtime** — `src/cron.ts` schedules the reconciler sweep and
  the orphan TTL eviction. Worker concerns never reach into route
  handlers; they call `LedgerService` directly so they share the same
  invariants as the API.

## Domain model

| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
|---|---|---|
| `action_ledger` | Intent record. Created the moment a user clicks a button, before any tx is signed. | `idempotency_key` (unique), `wallet_address`, `action_type`, `status`, `tx_hash`, `correlation_id`, `error_code`, `redacted_at` |
| `pending_events` | Indexer-first events that arrived before the matching intent attached its `tx_hash`. Drained on attach. | `tx_hash` (PK), `soroban_event_id`, `event_payload`, `status_hint`, `consumed_at` |
| `indexer_checkpoints` | Singleton indexer cursor and health checkpoint. | `latest_ledger`, `last_processed_event_id`, `last_sync_time`, `last_success_sync_time`, `last_error` |

Status machine (enforced in `src/constants.ts`):

```
pending  ──┬──► submitted ──┬──► confirmed
           │                ├──► reverted
           │                └──► orphaned   (TTL sweep — worker)
           └──► failed
```

The ledger never deletes rows. Privacy scrub (`DELETE /actions?wallet=…`)
nulls `action_payload` and sets `redacted_at`, preserving the audit
trail for the indexer.

### Why an intent-first ledger

An intent is durably recorded *before* the wallet signs anything, so:

- A wallet timeout / browser refresh can recover by replaying the
  `Idempotency-Key` rather than producing a duplicate on-chain tx.
- The indexer can publish events asynchronously without coordinating
  with the API process.
- The `correlation_id` is carried through every log line and structured
  error response so the frontend can quote it in support tickets.

## Request-log safety contract

Request logs are shipped to long-lived aggregation systems, so they must not
carry anything that identifies a wallet. `src/utils/logRedaction.ts` is the
single place that decides what a request may contribute to a log line, and
every request-scoped log statement goes through it - the `onRequest` and
`onResponse` hooks in `src/app.ts`, the validation middleware, the central
error handler, and the rate-limit plugin:

- **Route, not URL.** Lines carry `route`, the registered route template
  (`/actions/export`, `/api/privacy/deletion-manifest/:id`), never `req.url`.
  A request that matched no route falls back to a normalized path whose
  identifier-shaped segments become `:id` / `:wallet` / `:segment`.
- **Allowlisted query metadata.** Low-cardinality, non-identifying values
  (`limit`, `status`, `format`, `type`, `from`, `to`, `stale_after_ms`) are
  logged as-is. Wallet addresses, cursors, and ids are logged as short salted
  digests (`sha256:…`, salted by `LOG_REDACTION_SALT`), so a wallet's requests
  stay correlatable without the address itself being recoverable. Secret-like
  keys are dropped outright, and unrecognized keys default to `[redacted]` -
  the allowlist fails closed as routes gain parameters.
- **Both outcomes.** The same context is emitted on the success path, the
  validation-failure path, and the error path. Zod errors are logged as issue
  codes and field paths only, because a Zod message quotes the rejected value.
- **Backstop.** `createLogger` additionally redacts `url`, `wallet`, `cursor`,
  and credential headers at the pino level, so a call site that forgets the
  contract still cannot leak them. Values that are already salted digests pass
  through unchanged.

Prometheus HTTP metrics use the same route template, which keeps identifiers
out of metric labels and bounds label cardinality.

## Migration strategy

Schema lives in `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`. Migrations live in
`backend/prisma/migrations/` and are applied with the standard Prisma
flow — `prisma migrate dev` locally, `prisma migrate deploy` in CI and
production. Rollback is purposely *not* automated: every migration is
expected to be additive (new tables, new columns, new enum values).
Destructive changes require a paired migration that keeps the previous
schema readable until traffic has cut over.

## Local-development bootstrap

```bash
cp .env.example .env                  # set DATABASE_URL, INTERNAL_SECRET
pnpm install
pnpm exec prisma migrate deploy       # applies migrations to your local DB
pnpm dev                              # starts Fastify on $PORT, default 3000
pnpm test                             # vitest + testcontainers (needs Docker)
```

The default `.env.example` points at a local Postgres at
`localhost:5432`. Tests spin up an ephemeral Postgres 16 container per
run (`tests/helpers/db.ts`), so contributors don't need to manage a
test database manually.

## Configuration

All env vars are validated at boot in `src/env.ts` via Zod. Boot fails
loudly with a structured Zod error if anything is missing or malformed.
Required values:

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string. |
| `INTERNAL_SECRET` | Shared secret for `X-Internal-Secret` on `/internal/reconcile`. |
| `PORT` | HTTP port (optional, default 3000). |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Pino log level (`info`, `debug`, …). |
| `LOG_REDACTION_SALT` | Optional salt for hashed identifiers in logs. Random per process when unset. |

## Replay safety

`LedgerService.reconcileEvent` is the only path that writes a
confirmed/reverted status. It is wrapped in a Prisma transaction and
falls back to the `PendingEvent` table when the matching intent's
`tx_hash` has not yet been attached. The same transaction is invoked
from both the worker sweep and `POST /internal/reconcile`, so duplicate
deliveries from the indexer are idempotent.

## Smoke check

The repo ships a synchronous boot smoke test
(`tests/smoke.spec.ts`) that:

1. Boots the Fastify app with a Testcontainers Postgres instance
2. Applies the latest migrations via `prisma migrate deploy`
3. Asserts `/health` responds `200 { ok: true }`

Run it with `pnpm test -- smoke.spec.ts`. If this passes locally, the
backend stack is healthy enough for issues #13 and #14 to land work
against it.

## Relationship to the rest of the system

- **Frontend (#7, #14)** consumes only the public Fastify routes.
  Stale-data handling is driven by the `is_stale` flag returned from
  `GET /dashboard/summary`.
- **Soroban contracts (#10, #11, #12)** never call this service
  directly. Their events flow through the off-chain indexer (issue #13)
  and arrive here via `POST /internal/reconcile`.
- **Indexer (#13)** is the only producer of `PendingEvent` rows and the
  only authenticated caller of `/internal/reconcile`.
